    <h3>Prerequisites:</h4>
    <h4>Dependencies:</h5>
   <p>This application requires Docker to be installed on your machine. If you don't have Docker 
    installed, you can download and install it from the official Docker website:
    <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">download Docker</a>
  </p>

        

    <h4>Installation:</h5>
    <p>The application is meant to be self-hosted, hence to run it, you can download the Sarcasm AI archive from the following link:
      <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QVCYlfzJ0qmXrWJS6iGRxDTETj7oIwll?usp=drive_link">download SarcasmAi</a>
    </p>
      


    <h3>How to run:</h4>

    <p>
      Once the application archive is downloaded, it should be extracted. Now, in the console of your choice, go to the extracted directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The folder has two bootstrapping script files:
      <ul>
        <li>bootstrap (UNIX)</li>
        <li>bootstrap.bat (Windows)</li>
      </ul>
      To run the application, one has to execute a bootstrapping script and wait for the application to deploy.
      Once you see an IP-address with a port 5000 in the logs (e.g. 172.17.0.2:5000) it means the app is successfully deployed and accesisble via that link.
